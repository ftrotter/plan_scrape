Plan Scrape
===================

Uses a SERP API to find the front doors to the Payer FHIR endpoints

TODO
=====================

* Review Step20_Serp_Scrape.py to see how the search data is being used to search. 
* Create a new Step10_create_target_list.py that reads in both of the csv files into a merged search_these.csv which should be located in the main directory
* migrate Step20_Serp_Scrape.py to use the ./search_these.csv files.
